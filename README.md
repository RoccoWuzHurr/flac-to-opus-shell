i made this because i didn't trust anything on the play store and did not have access to my main pc to convert all of my files on my phone to .opus

needs to be placed in a folder containing folders which contain .flac files
doesn't work out of the box converting to or from any other file types, though it'd be very easy to modify it to do so

1.0 does not delete the flacs because i forgot to implement that and i'm remembering that i needed to as i type this out
custom bitrate doesn't work yet either . sorry
